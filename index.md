[Adult Income Prediction:](https://github.com/Lachandra41/Lachandra-Ash-Portfolio/tree/main/Adult%20Income%20Prediction%20with%20Machine%20Learning/)
The adult income prediction project goal is to predict the income of adults that reside in multiple countries. The income is greater than, equal to, or less than $50K per year. I used Naive Bayes model to predict accuracy of the adult income. Jupyter Python programming language was used to analyze the data.
